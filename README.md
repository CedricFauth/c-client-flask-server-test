# Web Tutorial: C Client and Python Web Server

A Tutorial/Example of how you can write a web client in C that connects to any web server using an encrypted https connection. 
Furthermore, we're going to write a Flask web server and deploy it using Nginx. We'll also generate self-signed certificates for test purposes.
